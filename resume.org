*** XRF Core software
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
    Wrote a program for the ITRAX XRF Scanner: [[https://geokon-gh.github.io/corascope/][Corascope]]
        - GUI Program in Clojure (cljfx/JavaFX)
        - XRF Data manipulation for reassembling sequentialy segments into a stratigraphically correct sequence.
    The final software was published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300421001977 \\
    And is available online: https://geokon-gh.github.io/corascope/

*** C++ Optimization + Build Systems
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
    Worked on a large C++ codebase for palm biometrics identification
        - Using profiling tools to find performance issue (valgrind/perf/gprof)
        - Optimizing code for performance (cache locality issues, vectorization, etc.)
        - Rewriting the build tools using Hunter/CMake
        - Maintaining builds of binaries for virtually all platform (android/ios/arm/windows/macos/linux)

*** Radar control systems
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
    Worked on a system of decentralized radar coordination for a small employee owned defense contractor - Toyon Research Corporation. The first half year I worked on a contract for a system coordinating shipborn radars for tracking aircraft. The remaining two years was on a system for tracking ballistic missiles through all stages of flight and to assist in anti-ballistic interception. Highlights:

        - Working on and maintaining a large C++(11) codebase
        - Designing a radar system for both physical accuracy as well as high performance (near real-time)
        - Designing a (boosted) ballistic missile simulation including multi-stage separation.
        - A full statistical evaluation of the mathematical correctness of the optimization algorithm.
